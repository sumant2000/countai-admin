# CountAI Admin Dashboard - Demo Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Demo

The project is now running with all requested features implemented! Here's how to test everything:

### 1. Worker Authentication
- Open http://localhost:3000
- You'll see a worker authentication dialog
- Enter any Worker ID (e.g., "DEMO123") 
- Optionally add your name
- Click "Continue" - your credentials will be stored in LocalStorage

### 2. Dashboard Features âœ…
Navigate to the Dashboard to see:
- **Daily Photo Count**: Shows photos taken today
- **Total Photos**: Cumulative count since launch  
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of processing failures
- **Model Usage Chart**: Bar chart showing API call frequency for all 5 models
- **Model Details**: Detailed breakdown with last usage times

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds and shows real-time data.

### 3. Photo Gallery Features âœ…
Click "Photo Gallery" in the sidebar to access:
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by date range, model, worker, and status
- **Worker Tracking**: See which worker took each photo
- **Photo Metadata**: View timestamps, confidence scores, file info
- **Detailed View**: Click any photo to see complete metadata
- **CSV Export**: Export filtered data with all metadata
- **Real-time Updates**: Manual refresh button available

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### âœ… Worker ID System
- LocalStorage-based authentication
- Worker identification tracked for all photos
- Persistent sessions across browser refreshes
- Easy logout/worker switching

#### âœ… Enhanced Dashboard
- Daily photo count with today's date filter
- Total cumulative count across all time
- Error rate calculation and display
- Usage graph for all 5 models (Round Type, Plate Type, ND Press, Baseboard, Aluminum Stairs)
- Live updating statistics

#### âœ… Advanced Photo Gallery
- Complete worker ID tracking
- Rich metadata display (file size, resolution, location)
- Confidence scores for each detection
- Error reason tracking for failed processing
- Multi-criteria filtering system
- Responsive pagination

#### âœ… CSV Export System
- Export all data or filtered subset
- Comprehensive data including:
  - Worker ID, timestamp, photo data
  - Model used, count results
  - Confidence scores, error details
  - File metadata (size, resolution, location)

### 5. Testing the Features

1. **Test Worker Authentication**:
   - Try logging in with different worker IDs
   - Close browser and reopen - should remember your worker
   - Use logout button to switch workers

2. **Test Dashboard**:
   - Watch the real-time clock update
   - Check that today's count reflects current date
   - View model usage statistics
   - See error rate calculations

3. **Test Photo Gallery**:
   - Filter by different date ranges
   - Filter by different workers (12345, 23456, 34567, 45678)
   - Filter by models and status
   - Click photos to see detailed metadata
   - Export CSV and check the downloaded file

4. **Test CSV Export**:
   - Export all data
   - Apply filters then export filtered data
   - Open CSV in Excel/Google Sheets to verify format

### 6. Architecture Overview

```
Authentication Flow:
Browser â†’ LocalStorage â†’ Worker Auth Component â†’ Admin Layout

Data Flow:
Mock Azure DB â†’ DataService â†’ Components â†’ UI

Export Flow:
Filtered Data â†’ CSV Service â†’ Browser Download
```

### 7. Next Steps for Production

To connect to real Azure database:
1. Replace mock data in `lib/services.ts` with actual Azure DB queries
2. Add environment variables for connection strings
3. Implement real-time WebSocket updates
4. Add error handling and retry logic
5. Implement data validation and sanitization

### 8. Technology Stack Used

- **Next.js 15** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **shadcn/ui** - UI components
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **LocalStorage** - Authentication persistence
- **date-fns** - Date manipulation

## âš¡ Quick Azure Deployment

Ready to deploy? Here are your options:

### Option 1: Azure Static Web Apps (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the automated deployment script
./deploy.sh

# Choose option 1 when prompted
# Follow the prompts to complete deployment
```

### Option 2: Manual Azure CLI Deployment
```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Create resource group
az group create --name countai-admin-rg --location eastus

# Create static web app
az staticwebapp create \
  --name countai-admin \
  --resource-group countai-admin-rg \
  --source . \
  --location eastus2 \
  --branch main \
  --app-location "/" \
  --output-location "out"
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (Automated CI/CD)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Azure Portal > Static Web Apps
3. Create new Static Web App
4. Connect to your GitHub repository
5. Azure will automatically set up CI/CD
