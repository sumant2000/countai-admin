```typescript
// Replace mock data methods with actual Azure DB calls
static async getPhotos(): Promise<PhotoData[]> {
  // Your Azure DB query implementation
}
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file for environment-specific configuration:
```env
AZURE_DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string
API_BASE_URL=your_api_url
```
